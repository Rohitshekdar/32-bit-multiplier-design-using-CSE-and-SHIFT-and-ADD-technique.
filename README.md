# DESIGN-OF-32-BIT-MULTIPLIER-USING-CSE-AND-SHIFT-ADD-TECHNIQUE
I worked on a comparative research between a 32-bit multiplier and a 32-bit CSE multiplier, where we determined the reasons behind the preference for CSE multipliers over regular multipliers for a number of crucial factors. Please download both the zip files as they are different multipliers and to compare them and their performance parameters you need to run them simultaneously in software like Vivado or ISE design.
